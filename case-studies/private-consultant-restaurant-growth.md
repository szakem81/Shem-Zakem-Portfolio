# Private Consultant Case Study — Restaurant Growth and Efficiency

**One-line summary**  
Transformed operations and launched new revenue channels for independent restaurants, driving a **36%** lift in online sales and a **21%** monthly revenue increase.

## Problem
Independent restaurants faced thin margins, inconsistent order accuracy, and limited digital sales channels that constrained growth and profitability.

## Approach
- Prioritized high‑ROI interventions: ordering integrations, order‑management optimization, menu engineering, and staff workflows.  
- Built a repeatable playbook: discovery → pilot → iterate → scale.  
- Integrated LLM and ML along with generative AI to accelerate insight generation, rank opportunities, and automate routine analysis.

## Execution
1. **Discovery and measurement** — Mapped order flows, measured order handling time and error rates, and ran margin analysis to identify high‑impact menu items. LLMs drafted initial SQL and ML models suggested cohort definitions.  
2. **Integrations** — Implemented multi‑platform mobile ordering and a direct ordering integration to centralize orders and reduce reconciliation.  
3. **Workflow redesign** — Reworked kitchen order flows, introduced first‑pass quality checks, and trained staff.  
4. **Productization** — Launched branded products and new menu items with targeted promotions.  
5. **Iteration and scaling** — Ran weekly experiments, instrumented results, and rolled successful changes across locations; ML models helped prioritize experiments by predicted ROI.

## Outcome
- **36%** lift in online sales.  
- **21%** reduction in order handling time and **29%** improvement in first‑pass accuracy.  
- **21%** monthly revenue uplift from new menu and branded products.  
- **~50%** reduction in time to produce analysis and presentation materials using LLM/ML and generative AI‑assisted workflows.
