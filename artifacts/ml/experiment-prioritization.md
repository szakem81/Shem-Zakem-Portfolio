Uplift modeling summary
- Objective: rank candidate experiments by expected incremental revenue and implementation effort.
- Inputs: historical conversion, activation time, order value, ops cost per hour.
- Approach: simple uplift model using logistic regression for activation probability and expected value calculation for revenue lift.
- Output: ranked list of experiments with predicted ROI and confidence intervals.
