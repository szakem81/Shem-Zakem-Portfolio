Triage

Monitor dashboard for cohort p90 and activation outliers.

If activation_time > p90, open a ticket and assign to Partner Success.

Message cadence

Default cadence: confirmation → 24h missing data → 48h verification → final notice at 7 days.

Respect opt‑outs and throttling rules.

Exception handling

Partner replies with missing info → update system and trigger manual verification.

Document upload failures → send secure upload link and escalate if repeated.

High error cohort → pause automation for cohort and run root cause analysis.

Upsell flow

Route accepted upsells to sales enablement with partner profile and recommended package.

Track conversion and revenue attribution.
